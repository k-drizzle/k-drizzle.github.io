         <h2>El Barrio de los Nuyoricans</h2>
         <p>The barrio where I reside is filled with the smell of arroz y frijoles, empanadas, y tamales; filled with the sounds of Marc Anthony and Romeo Santos, as well as the yells of little kids running on the sidewalks and teens playing basketball on the court. However, on the corner of 106 and Lexington there lies a beautiful work of art- a prepossessing mural portraying the representation of Puerto Ricans in New York or, more specifically, Spanish Harlem. There are references to Puerto Rico with all the flags and the red-eyed coqui (a national symbol for Puerto Rico). It includes things associated with hispanic culture like dominoes, two people dancing either salsa, merengue, or even bomba (the national dance of PR), and bongo playing. There are even things that we have related to low income neighborhoods (like Spanish Harlem) that have been integrated into our everyday lives; things like $1 icees, bikes in the streets, and open fire hydrants. Furthermore, there are things that make up New York that surround Spanish Harlem like the beautiful skyline, the presence of Nike, and the outside train. The most important part of this mural are the words; the signs saying, “ El Barrio” and “Hope Community” but the most prominent words are, “Aquí Me Quedo”. These words show how they viewed New York as a new beginning; a way for them to create a community so they can have a piece of Puerto Rico with them as they progress.</p>
         <p>Of course when Puerto Ricans integrated themselves into New York it didn't become Spanish Harlem immediately. It took hard work and pride in their community to truly become a part of New York. This hard work and dedication led them to also earn the title of Nuyorican. Being a Nuyorican doesn’t just mean being a Puerto Rican in New York; it means embracing your heritage and working hard to achieve the best you. Working hard allows you to be a New Yorker, being true to your Puerto Rican allows you to be a Nuyorican; this is what Spanish Harlem represents. It represents the hard work Puerto Ricans put in in order to showcase their culture and be accepted. It’s like a trophy for them to pass down generation to generation as a symbol of their progression. The whole portrayal of this mural is to show new people who may move into el barrio what lays there not just physically but underneath the surface. The rich history of Spanish Harlem and to show how it’s still standing; the way the original community hasn’t been affected fully by challenges such as gentrification. An identification of the way Nuyoricans come in different sizes but keep their flags close to their chest. The dominos played on the corners, the icee man walking around, and the kids running through the fire hydrant after a long game of basketball shows the small victories; it’s an indicator of the triumph of assimilating their views into this “new” territory. Just the simple fact that there’s proof of the older generation,as portrayed in the mural, is pretty freaking cool.</p>
         <p>Spanish Harlem, through the eyes of the mural, represents a lively and prideful community. It still is to this day. Even though the mural is on 106th street, Spanish Harlem actually extends from 96th street to 116th street. There you see a bunch of Nuyoricans come to celebrate lots of events, most notably the Puerto Rican Day parade. This has New Yorkers and Nuyoricans come together in order to celebrate Puerto Ricans: the food, music, and overall culture enriches the lives of those who don’t know; it even includes those who do know of Puerto Ricans. It’s filled with people roaming the streets filled with pride (or maybe just Piña coladas) hanging out and having fun. It not only provides me with more information on my culture but also allows for people to stay in touch with themselves as Nuyoricans and with the past generations shown on the mural. This is because at the end of the day, “aquí me quedo”. I’ll stay here. We’ll stay here. Nuyoricans will stay here.</p>
